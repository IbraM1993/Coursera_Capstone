# Predicting Car Accident Severity in Seattle, USA, using Machine Learning
#### This is for the IBM Data Science Specialization.
The project aims to predict a car accident severity in Seattle, United States using the power of machine learning.

Python was used to preprocess the data and implement the Machine Learning algorithms. The notebook has detailed description reagrding every step along with important visualizations, and comments in the code when found necessary.

4 algorithms were used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest

All of the algorithms had an **accuracy higher than 90%** on both training and testing datasets, as wello as **high precision and recall**.
